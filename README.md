# Web-Design-Challenge
This assignment consisted of creating a website displaying plots and a data table.

# What the code does
The code uses Bootstrap and CSS to customize an HTML page, creating a dashboard for a subset of the information gathered and analyzed in the **python-api-challenge** (https://github.com/emeralddawns/python-api-challenge).

The **HTML** files create indivdual pages displaying the following:
    
    1. index.html: A landing page with explanation of the project.

    2. cloudiness.html: A plot displaying Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude and a brief analysis of the results.

    3. humidity.html: A plot displaying Humidity (%) vs. Latitude and a brief analysis of the results.

    4. maxtemp.html: A plot displaying Maximum Temperature (F) vs. Latitude and a brief analysis of the results.

    5. windspeed.html: A plot displaying Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude and a brief analysis of the results.

    6. comparisons.html: All four (4) plots on the same page, for the sake of comparison.  Each plot links to the page created specifically for that plot. 

    7. data.html: A responsive table that contains the data used in the four (4) visualizations.

All pages include a navigation menu with links leading the user to any other desired page.

All pages, with the exception of comparisons.html and data.html, display a sidebar with all four (4) plots displayed. Each plot links to the page created specifically for that plot.
